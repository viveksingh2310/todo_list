error.ejs
register.ejs
login.ejs
list.ejs(done)- add the different functionality :- 
    1)making a todo important (we have to update the view and provide neccessary js for the button click)
    2)marking a task as done and puttin it inside done List(changing view and makring a new field of isDone in mongodb as well)
    3)Updating a task(updating the view and addition of the new cdontainer for updation purposes of the task)

Future features they should be handled later while implementing the incremental model in the website:-
1)Integration of the Google Calendar API
2)Email-based authentication on registering and for login the cookies should be used
3)Generating the user performance based on the task he/she has done on weekly or monthly basis
